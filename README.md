# Discord Invite Finder  
Searches for random Discord invites and validates them.  

A pre-made algorithm is included to ensure efficient functionality.  

You can modify the speed at which it attempts to find invites in line 156 (default: 1.5).  
Note: If you set the value too low or remove the wait time entirely, you may get rate-limited.
